    <name>Build Variant Matrix Selector</name>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Select variant by selecting flavors in a matrix instead of through the drop down lists provdided by IntelliJ/Android Studio
in the "Build Variants" view. In addition this plugin selects variants for all modules at the same time, even
when there are multiple leaf modules. This results in a very fast and intuitive way of switching variants
for all modules.</p>
<br/>
<p>
Usage: Bind a key to the action named "Select Build Variant by Matrix" and press that combination after loading an Android project.
You will then be presented with the dialog to select the variant.
